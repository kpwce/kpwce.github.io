In the UW's intricate major system, most students consider pursuing one major and perhaps a second major. Specializing in a third discipline is rare. Why and how would anyone do it?</p>\n<p>In 2024, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Mathematics and Spanish from the University of Washington. This combination is formally two degrees with two majors for the BA degree within the College of Arts and Sciences, but ignoring semantic differences, this sums to three majors.</p>\n<p>While I don't believe that there's anything extraordinary about triple majors in general, there is one asset that sets triple majors apart: a high competence for navigating the UW's major system and degree planning.</p>\n<p>I'm writing this candid piece to share the wins and learns from my experience triple majoring and demystify aspects of academic planning at the UW. I'm not an advisor and every student is unique, so advising is best for up-to-date and accurate information about specific circumstantial questions. It’s better to ask questions early rather than discovering that a department had a sudden shift in degree requirements — speaking from experience here!</p>\n<h2>Double degree and double majors at UW</h2>\n<p>A typical degree requires 180 completed credits, roughly split in half between general education courses and major-specific courses. Any credits remaining are set aside as free electives. A typical course is 3-5 credits that intend to mirror the hours spent in class per week, and a typical workload for a single quarter that spans 3 months is 12-18 credits. The major-specific courses are determined by a student's declared major. In a single degree, a student can double major, where two sets of major-specific courses must be completed. The number of major-specific courses varies greatly between majors. Some humanities programs require 50 credits while some engineering programs require closer to 100 credits. Some majors have a competitive application for admissions, while others can be declared at any time.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when a second major corresponds to a different degree program (e.g., in a different college or BA instead of a BS), a student can do a double degree, which has the requirements of a double major, as well as (1) any general education requirements for the second degree that wasn't present in the first and (2) 225 completed credits. Some departments also offer minors, often referred to as a subspecialization, reflecting roughly 20-30 credits of coursework. A student is allowed to take on up to 3 optional minors per degree.</p>\n<h2>Specifics of my why and how</h2>\n<p>If anyone had asked in high school, I told them that I wanted to triple major in computer science, math and Spanish. I know it sounded crazy, and even I was a little skeptical about the feasibility. At the time, I was interested in pursuing a career in teaching mathematics and was passionate about Hispanic literature. I was also considering teaching mathematics bilingually in English and Spanish. I have always been interested in some assortment of the humanities and the sciences. I thought it would be worthwhile to explore programming, too, given both its growing relevance as a practical skill and my interests in language and math, so I applied to the UW's computer science major and was directly admitted into the program as a freshman starting in Autumn 2021.</p>\n<p>I had many credits completed (equivalent to 125 credits in total at the time when UW evaluated them) through dual enrollment coursework and AP exams that transferred to my undergraduate degree, fulfilling all lower division prerequisites. During my first quarter at the UW, I only took courses for the CS major and general education requirements. While taking junior-level classes in computer science, I decided to plan out the math double degree with my CS departmental advisor, and apply for the math major (teaching prep track) during winter quarter. I also took my first Spanish course that quarter but waited until the next to apply to the Spanish major when I was confident that I could handle the workload. My timeline for coursework and applications to majors was ambitious. I likely could've slowed this down but it was nice to get priority registration for all my major-specific classes by my second year.</p>\n<p>For general education requirements, my Spanish courses fulfilled all the Art &#x26; Humanities credits and my CS and math prerequisite coursework fulfilled Natural Science credits. The Social Science credits were covered by my dual enrollment coursework. Each major required around 60 program-specific credits each. The math and computer science majors had 2 overlapping program-specific requirements. The 225 credits required for a double degree were automatically completed after an additional 3 years of classes at the UW. I graduated having around 270 credits on my college transcript from high school and UW.</p>\n<p>I do not regret doing three majors but I wish I had taken one extra quarter to offset the workload of my heavier quarters. It worked well for me because I love taking classes, enjoy a challenge and had a significant number of prerequisites done.</p>\n<p>Having said that, I strongly suggest thinking about alternative ways to achieve a desired outcome to any student considering doing three majors. I don't try to disuade others from following my footsteps and it's more of a fall forward if things don't work out. However, the reality is that it's an unrealistic and excessive path for most. I've seen two other success stories, but it doesn't work for everyone. In 99 out of 100 cases, I see more arguments against than in favor of picking up two additional majors.</p>\n<h2>Expectations versus reality</h2>\n<h3>Quarterly Course Schedules</h3>\n<p>When making degree plans for advising appointments, I listed out all the courses I wanted to take and the quarters I wished to take them. While advising would approve them with minor changes based on long-term departmental schedules, I was optimistic about being able to take one course specific to each major per quarter, for a balanced schedule throughout college. My actual course schedules for each quarter were largely different from what I had planned due to cancellations and time schedule conflicts between classes. I ended up prioritizing strict, major-required coursework over more flexible electives. This involved a lot of replanning on a quarterly basis. After scheduling the must-have courses, I looked for gaps in my schedule and the remaining requirements I had.</p>\n<p>I had a tendency to take math courses over computer science and Spanish courses, resulting in a lot of math-heavy quarters early on. I took 2-3 quarters across my entire undergraduate schedule that were stressful under the pressure of finishing the math major. Oftentimes, I would have schedules conflicting with lunch, so I replaced lunches in favor of small snacks that could be consumed in a 10-minute walk to my next class. Less quarterly credits didn't always mean an easier schedule. A 13-credit schedule with 3 math courses was much more difficult than many of the 18-credit schedules I had. Usually, I could gauge schedule difficulty by asking peers for course information or reading syllabi during the first week.</p>\n<p>My original plan had me taking 3-4 courses every quarter until graduation. It turned out that I had other interests that I wanted to explore during college, so I elected to have a non-optimal schedule some quarters in order to try new things. This included course and research credits outside of the three majors that counted for nothing more than my personal enrichment. When courses that interested me were offered, I would opt to stack 4-5 classes in a quarter rather than waiting another quarter to take less interesting courses. In addition, I eventually changed my teaching preparation specialization in the math major to a general track, when I did not want to take a last elective math course that the former path required. At the UW, the teaching track requirements were more restrictive and required more credits than the general BA math requirements. I did not consider doing the BS math option, as I was interested in teaching in mathematics and some of the more teaching-focused courses did not count towards the BS option requirements. If I hadn't finished a major, it wouldn't have been a big deal, just an administrative hassle and temporary disappointment in myself if anything.</p>\n<h3>Advising</h3>\n<p>There was a large advising overhead, as none of the three departments I was in were in sync with one another. If no in-person meeting was necessary, I learned that the easiest way to resolve issues is to add all advising departments together in one email chain. If I needed degree-related planning done, I had to schedule advising appointments with all three departments, all of which gave three separate sets of advice on how I should plan my classes. Soon enough, I realized that I had to do most of the coordination and planning.</p>\n<h3>Grades</h3>\n<p>People generally expected grades to fall and work quality to deteriorate as a consequence of a heavy workload. When I lost the perfect 4.0 during my second quarter of college (it felt worse than it was in reality), I stopped worrying about grades. At the same time, I take pride in the work I produce and like to learn. I learned to manage time well and developed a keen attention to detail. My GPA says I did well in most of my courses but that's not the full picture. Some of it was an outcome of grading systems, their leniency or lack thereof when trying to map learning to a number. Some of it was product of my mindset and study habits. The variety in classes was refreshing, keeping me free from burnout most quarters. I've learned to enjoy some of the spontaneous context switching. Going to a Spanish class after working on math problems for 4 hours became an exciting breath of fresh air, as was switching from analyzing Spanish theatre over the weekend to discussing databases on Monday.</p>\n<p>A common question is the extent to which grades matter and if simply passing with a 2.0 is sufficient. While it depends on personal circumstances, grade requirements tend to fall in buckets and come secondary to some other factor. Competitive major admissions and jobs may do a weak filter on GPAs. When a student has more relevant experience, that will almost always overtake the importance of grades: research experience for PhD programs, or previous software work for technology internships. Grades mattered for me. Performing well in coursework convinced advisors that I could successfully complete all my majors and it was a large factor in the particular graduate program I applied to.</p>\n<h3>People</h3>\n<p>Although I went into this plan with a class-focused mindset, the interesting coursework and personal determination only got me so far. What pushed me the rest of the way was the connections I made in different departments and the collective diversity of thought that I was exposed to from engaging with people in different disciplines.</p>\n<p>In all three departments, I loved learning from the faculty. From experts in Medieval Spanish literature to modern cryptography, my professors inspired me to stay curious, question culture, negotiate meaning and pursue knowledge. In my classes, I met students with backgrounds ranging from law and education to neuroscience that were passionate about changing the world. I've met many like-minded peers that I wouldn't have had I been in one program. My classmates that have taken courses with me have become life-long friends. The people I met throughout college have altered my view of the world, allowed me to draw insightful connections across disciplines and deepened my admiration for academic scholarship.</p>\n<p>I would go as far as to say that if I were to go back in time, I'd do three majors again just for the people I get to experience it with along the way. The people made it worth it.</p>\n<h3>Breadth vs. Depth</h3>\n<p>A common criticism I get about having multiple majors is that majors are areas of expertise, so extra majors are a waste. Sometimes, the lack of depth in my schedule made it feel as though I had only completed a fraction of each major, compared to my peers that focused fully on one discipline. I reasoned that most of this feeling is a result of imposter syndrome and an unfair premise for comparison to begin with. The quantity-quality tradeoff misplaces the value of multiple majors in the first place.</p>\n<p>First, an observation: the computer science, mathematics and Spanish departments are structurally disconnected. Within each department, I was treated as a student from that department, and even I often introduced myself with just the relevant major to fit in with other students and avoid a lengthy explanation. I was no longer answering questions from my CSE peers on why I studied a language seemingly distant from any tangible computer science applications nor those from Spanish students wanting me to fix a malfunctioning projector (still happy to do this, though!). I developed a sense of belonging in each department and took the initiative to learn as much as I could wherever I was. I found the majority of classes that I took at UW rewarding, often taking extra time to probe beyond the minimum requirements for essays and projects. All this is to say that my academics were on par with other students with a single major, though it sometimes felt as if I were living three lives in a university.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it's worth acknowledging a natural overlap between math and computer science. Some of those were many CS and math double majors that bonded over the similarities between the two curricula through advanced coursework in combinatorics, algebra and analysis. I, too, stumbled upon these pockets of intersection but was not deeply invested in theory, since the fields of study are massive and I wanted to take courses with minimal overlap. A consequence of this was meeting different people with different values in every class I took. I took a rather generic track through the CS program and focused on pedagogy in the math department. This was driven by my curiosity and eagerness to gain breadth in an unfamiliar discipline, a love for teaching, and, on a secondary level, scheduling constraints with Spanish courses. The amount of breadth wasn't a major concern; I already had the foundation to deepen my understanding of one discipline if I ever wanted to.</p>\n<p>By looking at individual parts rather than their sum, my academic interests are fragmented. But, all these parts are all highly interconnected and arguably more than the sum of its parts. For instance, learning mathematics has allowed me to be a better computer science theory teacher and further analyze concepts about space in Spanish literature. Learning computer science has helped me develop a keen eye for detail and given me a programming toolkit to solve problems with computation in both mathematics and Spanish. Learning Spanish has shown me the nuances in building an inclusive world in science and mathematics with non-English speakers. In some ways, I have a jack-of-all-trades dilemma. In others, I have a stronger grasp of where these fields intersect by being able to reason about them through different perspectives.</p>\n<h3>Are 3 majors x3 work?</h3>\n<p>3 majors almost never corresponds to triple the work due to possible general education and major-specific overlaps. Nonetheless, it's much simpler to manage the coursework for 1 major rather than 3 and doing 3 majors still is a lot of work with administrative overhead. I always maintained engagement in all my classes each quarter, which takes a lot of time. In addition to managing extra classes, there is some time dedicated to scheduling and planning with advising. Extra classes, course substitutes, or extra quarters may be necessary to finish all major requirements. This can cost time and money.</p>\n<h3>Does doing 3 majors provide x3 opportunities?</h3>\n<p>There is often a diminishing return on investment when doing additional majors. Employers expect one major, and there are not many career paths that require more than one major. Most times, extracurricular activities, such as internships, research and participation in student organization, can provide valuable interdisciplinary experience that aligns with students’ interests. A minor might be more desirable for those wanting to complete coursework in a specific department while prioritizing another specialization, as minor requirements are more lenient than major requirements.</p>\n<p>There are opportunities that a second or third major can open up. Students in a particular major are nearly always prioritized for major-specific, upper division coursework, and there are often department-specific opportunities that prefer students in a particular major. At a surface-level glance, departments tend to better promote opportunities to students in their programs, making them more accessible. If a department is resource-rich with seemingly inexhaustible opportunities (e.g., Allen School) and a student’s interests are contained within that department, pursuing another major may not be as beneficial.</p>\n<p>When a second major is relevant, employers and graduate programs may take notice. Consistent performance in multiple majors illustrates ability to manage time, organize work and succeed in multiple disciplines. Completing the full course of study provides a student with a breadth of knowledge of the subject. This can be a tradeoff with depth, where participating in research projects, internships, and other academic activities gives hands-on experience with the material that builds more specialized knowledge.</p>\n<p>There's also a career flexibility argument to be made. I don't always agree with job requirements but a lot of them are phrased as \"Bachelor’s degree in X or in a related field\". I've found that having multiple majors enables flexible career changes by being able to check more boxes.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>On paper, a triple major looks impressive. I know people who have reached out to me to connect in classes because of it. When I explain my winding academic path, I'm often met with exclamations: do you sleep!? Or simply, wow! And, yes, as with any busy schedule not necessarily specific to managing three majors, there may be a tradeoff with sleep, social life, food, or friends. My college transcript certainly tells a unique story about me. But it's a story that's superficial. It pains me when it becomes an unreasonable point of comparison, when it suddenly becomes a symbol of vanity. By reducing thoughtful moments into majors, courses and grades, it transforms a part of my college experience into a list of transactions. Under an analogous purview, this is my story about my transcript. It makes the course-related decisions I took make sense. It doesn't capture how these decisions and experiences fit into a larger timeline, including what came before college and what will come after.</p>\n<p>In a fast-paced, unpredictable life, college taught me how to see the world as my playground, where there are always new people to meet and knowledge to uncover. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to explore many areas of study, and I'm off to dive deeper into the threads that piqued my interests during graduate school.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/triple-major","title":"A reflection on doing a triple major in college"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bf0244bb-40a7-5404-863d-391b42b69b11","frontmatter__slug":"/triple-major","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"triple-major"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
