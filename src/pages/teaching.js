    A list of teaching-related engagements I am a part of. For now, excludes tutoring, mentorship programs and volunteering activities.

    <h2 className="recipe-title">Teaching assistant at University of Washington</h2>
    <ul className="recipe-list">
      <li>6 quarters of CSE 311 (discrete math with computing applications)</li>
      <li>1 quarter of CSE 331 (software design and implementation)</li>
      <li>1 quarter of CSE 332 (data structures and parallelism)</li>
    </ul>

    <p> My time as a TA in the Allen School included grading homework assignments and assessments for over 300 students per quarter, as well as drafting both student-facing and internal course materials. I taught 1-2 weekly sections complementing lecture content, led review sessions, hosted 1-2 hours of weekly office hours, and answered online discussion board questions.
