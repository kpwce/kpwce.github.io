In my third year of college, I took a Spanish course that is jointly offered with the Textual Studies department. It was a mix of Spanish, technology and history - a unique experience that was one of my favorites in college. That's when I first learned about interdisciplinary opportunies in [textual studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_scholarship); I was intrigued.

## "Interdisciplinary"

The terms *interdisciplinary* and *multidisciplinary* are becoming academic buzzwords. People frequently misuse one for the other, though most percieved them as levels of collaboration, such as the one proposed for medical research in Rosenfield (1992):[^1]

Multidisciplinary
> Researchers work in parallel or sequentially from disciplinary-specific base to address common problem.

Interdisciplinary
> Researchers work jointly but still from disciplinary-specific basis to
address common problem.

Transdisciplinary
> Researchers work jointly using shared conceptual framework drawing together disciplinary-specific theories, concepts, and approaches to address common problem.

While not everyone agrees with those definitions and it can be hard to classify what actually is interdisciplinary,[^2] the idea is that novelty can come out of research that engages multiple perspectives and concepts from different disciplines.[^3]

A similar principle can be seen in the workforce. More and more companies are coming to value diversity in thought when hiring. Out of both academic interest and career necessity, schools have added interdisciplinary education tracks.

As a student at the University of Washington, I got to learn about some of these interdisciplinary programs and at first I was skeptical about their utility. For instance, the undergraduate [Comparative History of Ideas](https://chid.washington.edu/) program lets students choose nearly every class they take in what seems to be a situation where you get what you put in with little standardization for program outcomes. Futhermore, taking an interdisciplinary major means students get less of each discipline in most cases. Take biochemistry requirements, which involve less required biology and chemistry courses than those separate degrees, respectively. However, in this latter case, there is more standardization in what a biochemistry student will know - organic chemistry, human anatomy, etc. Depending on what a student wants to do, these interdisciplinary tracks can be great, and of course, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research happens frequently in a university.

As a multidisciplinary student at the end of my third year, I had grown eager to join some interdisciplinary programs after constantly switching contexts between three disjoint departments and doing work[^4] that heavily valued one discipline.

This eagerness combined with the timely experience in the aforementioned Spanish course drew me to explore the [Textual Studies](https://txtds.uw.edu/) programs at the University of Washington.

## Textual Studies Graduate Certificate

The Textual Studies department has an undergraduate minor and Graduate Certificate program, both which required a set of 3-4 Textual Studies courses and a capstone project.

I was graduating by the time I found out about the minor, so I enrolled in the certificate program when I was doing the graduate portion of the BS/MS Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) program. I was the first CSE degree student to take this path, with the Textual Studies Graduate Certificate being only a few years old. It took me a year to satisfy the requirements, taking 1 relevant course per quarter and doing my capstone during the last quarter.

It's a tight-knit department and all the classes I took were jointly offered with undergraduate versions, occasionally with a humanities department version. The students came from all over campus, but there was notably a higher number of Information School and English students. The faculty teaching my classes were from the Information School or a language department. Most classes are taught around group projects.

Here are some highlights.
- Visits to the University of Washington Special Collections
- Guest lectures from people doing digital preservation work
- A solid foundation in archival principles through reading assignments and discussions
- Hands-on digitization work with tools and frameworks that textual scholars use
- Low-stakes capstone that allows students to expand on prior work in the context of textual and digital studies

And some other observations.
- Limited course options, as the department is small and was offering 1-2 courses per quarter that would count towards the certificate
- As someone with coding background, the coding aspect wasn't interesting and catered towards beginners with little to no coding experience

Personally, I enjoyed the program as it exposed me to problems that had never crossed my mind. What impact does optical character recognition (OCR) have in search and discovery? How does digitization impact reading experience? How do we trace and document the editions of a text? How does metadata get generated? If any of these questions sound interesting, I would recommend taking a look at the program!
